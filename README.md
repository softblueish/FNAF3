## Notes
This is a passion project. I love FNAF 3 and wanted to see it ported to other systems. If you haven't already, check out the steam page for [Five Nights at Freddys 3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/354140/Five_Nights_at_Freddys_3/)
## Controls
Press **Enter** to Fullscreen. I assume you know how to play FNAF 3.
